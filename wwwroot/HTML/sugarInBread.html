                    The 2020 ruling in Ireland that has deemed Subway's sandwich bread too sugar-laden to be technically defined as actual bread gives rise to questions about other bread in the food supply: Why is there sugar in a savory food like bread in the first place? And if a restaurant's bread has high amounts of sugar, what about the ones we grab off grocery store shelves?
                    The ruling in Ireland was derived from an old value-added tax law stating that the sugar content of bread cannot exceed two percent of the weight of flour in the dough and be considered a food staple. Because Subway bread was found to have a sugar content of approximately 10 percent by weight, it far exceeded this threshold.

                    So, How Much Sugar Is In Bread Products?
                    The ingredients for making basic bread are not significant sources of natural sugar (i.e. flour, water, salt),
                    so any amount of sugar above 1 gram per serving on a nutrition facts label will be added sugar. There is a big
                    range of sugar content in breads found on supermarket shelves. Some contain none, while others can include upwards of 4 grams per slice,
                    including breads with enticing labels such as “healthy multi-grain” or “organic grain and seed,”
                    and especially any bread with the word honey in the descriptor.
                    Now, if a few slices of bread were the only source of added sugar in the average American’s diet,
                    this would not be a major cause of concern but the fact is that sugar is a common ingredient in most processed foods—even “healthy” ones and it can quickly add up.
                    And for PB&J lovers, a simple sandwich can turn into a sugar bomb from the hidden sugar in the bread,
                    potentially hidden sugar in peanut butter (another story for another time), and of course, the added sugar in the jelly.
                    Current Sugar Intake Recommendations
                    The World Health Organization (WHO) and current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a daily sugar intake of less than 10 percent 
                    of total calories for both adults and children. This means, for those consuming an average 2,000-calorie diet, this is less than 200 calories 
                    from sugar, which is the equivalent to 50 grams of added sugar (or approximately 12 teaspoons). The WHO goes on to state that reducing sugar intake
                    to less than 5 percent of calories (25 grams or approximately 6 teaspoons) per day would have even greater health benefits, 
                    but this has not been established as a formal policy.  According to the US Dietary Guidelines Report 2015-2020, 
                    the average American consumes 270 calories from sugar per day (nearly 17 teaspoons or over 1/3 cup)!
